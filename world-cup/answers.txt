Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
Small amount of similations still gave a similar predictions of winning of larger simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
I think the program stabalizes after 10000 simulations.
